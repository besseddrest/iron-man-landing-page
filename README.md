Having fun with the Marvel API

* Next.js
    * to gain exp
* React
    * common, popular
* Typescript
    * to get more practice
* Bulma + Custom SCSS + BEM
    * Bulma for semantics, responsive classes
    * Custom SCSS
    * BEM naming is the best
* **Why not TailwindCSS?**
    * semantics really important to me, in general I dislike verbosity of Tailwind
    * for this project only want to use responsive features
    * I like Sass better, has been a pain to configure IDE for Tailwind nesting
